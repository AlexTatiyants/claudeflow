Prepare feature for development: $ARGUMENTS

## Context Detection

**First, detect where this command is running:**

Check if `.git` is a file (worktree) or directory (main repo):
```bash
if [ -f .git ]; then
  # Running inside a worktree - environment refresh mode
else
  # Running in main repo - full prep mode
fi
```

- **In main repo:** Run full workflow (generate tasks, create worktree, etc.)
- **In worktree:** Run environment setup only (symlinks, etc.)

---

## Mode A: Full Prep (Running from Main)

### Auto-Detection Logic

1. **Check for feature name argument**
   - If provided: use that feature
   - If not provided: look in `work/features/` for uncommitted folders

2. **Handle multiple features**
   - If exactly ONE uncommitted feature: use it automatically
   - If MULTIPLE uncommitted features: list them and ask which one
   - If NO uncommitted features: show error

3. **Validate feature is ready**
   - Ensure `work/features/<feature-name>/` exists
   - Ensure `reqs.md` exists
   - Ensure `plan.md` exists
   - If anything is missing, show error with what's needed

### Full Prep Workflow

1. **Generate task list**
   - Read `plan.md` from the feature folder
   - Extract all implementation steps
   - Create `tasks.md` with numbered task IDs (TSK1, TSK2, etc.)
   - Each task should be atomic and testable

2. **Create git worktree**
   - Determine project name from current directory
   - Create worktree at `../<project-name>.worktrees/<feature-name>/`
   - Auto-create parent directory if it doesn't exist
   - Create branch: `feature/<feature-name>`

3. **Move feature folder to worktree**
   - Move entire `work/features/<feature-name>/` directory
   - From: `<project>/work/features/<feature-name>/`
   - To: `<project>.worktrees/<feature-name>/work/features/<feature-name>/`
   - This removes it from main (no longer uncommitted there)

4. **Handle gitignored files** (see Environment Setup below)

5. **Open VS Code**
   - Run: `code ../<project-name>.worktrees/<feature-name>/`
   - Inform user: "New VS Code window should open. Switch to it and run `/feature-build` to start implementation."
   - Optionally mention: "Run `/feature-docker start` to launch isolated Docker environment for testing."

---

## Mode B: Environment Refresh (Running from Worktree)

When running `/feature-prep` from inside an existing worktree, skip worktree creation and only run environment setup.

### Worktree Environment Workflow

1. **Confirm context**
   - Detect worktree by checking if `.git` is a file
   - Extract main repo path from `.git` file contents
   - Inform user: "Detected worktree environment. Running environment setup only."

2. **Run environment setup** (see Environment Setup below)

3. **Report completion**
   - List what was symlinked/updated
   - Remind user to restart Claude Code extension if commands were updated

---

## Environment Setup (Shared)

This section runs in both modes: during full prep (step 4) and during environment refresh.

**Handle gitignored files:**
- Git worktrees don't include gitignored files like `.env`, `.vscode/`, etc.
- Symlink essential files from main to worktree:
  - `.env` files → so environment config is shared
  - `.vscode/` → optional, for editor settings
- Commands in `.claude/commands/` are tracked in git and available automatically

**Symlink creation logic:**
- Check if symlink already exists and points to correct location → skip
- Check if symlink exists but is broken → remove and recreate
- Check if regular file/directory exists → warn user, don't overwrite
- If nothing exists → create symlink

## Task List Template (tasks.md)

```markdown
# Task List: <Feature Name>

## Summary

<2-3 sentence summary distilled from plan.md: what the feature does and key architectural decisions. This provides context for new sessions without needing to read the full plan.>

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Complete ONE task at a time. After each task, STOP and wait for user feedback before continuing. Never implement multiple tasks without pausing.

> 🐳 **DOCKER:** If this project has Docker configured, run ALL commands (npm, migrations, tests, builds, etc.) inside the Docker container using `docker-compose exec app <command>`. Never run commands locally when Docker is available.

## Commit Point Guidelines

When creating the task list, group related tasks together and add commit points after each logical unit. Good commit points:

- **Are self-contained:** The code works after this commit (no broken intermediate states)
- **Have clear scope:** One sentence describes what the commit does
- **Are meaningful:** Each commit adds recognizable value or functionality

Examples of good groupings:
- Data models + validation logic → "Add user data model with validation"
- API endpoints + error handling → "Add user CRUD API endpoints"
- UI components + styling → "Add user management UI"
- Tests for a feature area → "Add tests for user authentication"

## Important Notes
- Each task should be granular enough to complete in one session
- Tasks are worked through one at a time in `/feature-build`
- NEVER commit without permission during `/feature-build`
- After prep completes, switch to new VS Code window and run `/feature-build`

## Gitignored Files Reference

Git worktrees only include tracked files. Gitignored directories like `.claude/`, `.env`, etc. won't be in the worktree by default. The Environment Setup section above handles this automatically.

**What gets symlinked:**
- ✓ `*.env*` files - For environment config
- ✓ `.vscode/` - If you want shared editor settings
- ✗ `.claude/` - Commands are in git, settings are feature-specific
- ✗ Dependencies directories - Reinstall in worktree instead (e.g., node_modules, vendor, venv)
- ✗ `.git/` - Already handled by git worktree

**Why symlinks?**
- Consistent environment config across worktrees
- Less disk space usage for shared settings

**Manual symlink commands** (if needed):
```bash
cd ../<project>.worktrees/<feature-name>/

# Environment variables (if you have .env files)
ln -s ../../<project>/.env .env
ln -s ../../<project>/.env.local .env.local

# VS Code settings (optional - if you want shared settings)
ln -s ../../<project>/.vscode .vscode
```

**After adding new symlinks:** Restart Claude Code extension in VS Code to pick up commands.

**Tip:** If you discover you need additional symlinks after the worktree was created, update your `/feature-prep` extension and run `/feature-prep` again from within the worktree to refresh the environment.

## Error Messages

If feature is not ready:
```
Error: Feature '<feature-name>' is not ready for prep.

Missing:
- [ ] reqs.md (run /feature-start first)
- [x] plan.md
- [ ] feature not found

Complete the missing items before running /feature-prep.
```

## Extensions
Check for `.claude/claudeflow-extensions/feature-prep.md`. If it exists, read it and incorporate any additional instructions, template sections, or workflow modifications.
